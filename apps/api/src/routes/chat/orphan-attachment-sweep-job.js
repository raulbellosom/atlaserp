//
// Deletes abandoned "pending" chat attachments: rows written by
// presignAttachmentUpload (message_id NULL) that never got linked to a sent
// message. The composer deletes its own removed/unsent uploads via
// DELETE /chat/attachments/:id, but a closed tab, a crash, or an offline
// client leaves the row + storage object behind. This sweep is the safety net.
//
// Threshold: the presigned upload URL expires in 300s, so anything with a NULL
// message_id older than a couple hours is certainly abandoned. Never touch a
// compose still in progress (long voice note, slow upload, user stepped away).
